<p>If you sell content or products on your WordPress site, then you know how important it is to get your online shop set up just right. Even the slightest delay or error in a check-out process can deter a potential customer. This is especially true if you’ve created a storefront on a custom-built WordPress site – your checkout experience needs to be seamless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there’s a popular plugin in the WordPress world called <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> that serves as the gold standard for WordPress shops and checkout solutions. WooCommerce unlocks the ability to turn your website into an online shop, allowing you to sell products, collect payments, and let customers manage accounts.</p>



<p>If you sell courses, using WooCommerce as your storefront is one of the simplest decisions you can make, but there are a few considerations before you move ahead. Let’s explore when it makes sense to use WooCommerce.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reasons-to-use-woocommerce-for-selling-courses">Reasons to use WooCommerce for selling courses</h3>



<p>WooCommerce has become the go-to storefront on WordPress because it offers <a href="https://woocommerce.com/features/">robust features</a>. Considering how specific features will meet your needs can help you determine if it’s the right option for selling your course. Here’s why you might want to use it:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Use any payment gateway</strong>: One of the biggest strengths of WooCommerce is the vast number of payment options available. LearnDash is already integrated with Paypal, Razorpay, and Stripe. If you’d like to use another payment gateway, there are <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/">100+ payment gateways</a> available for WooCommerce— more than any other ecommerce plugin.</p>



<p><strong>Tons of customization</strong>: WooCommerce lets you customize to your heart’s content and control the way customers experience purchasing your course. You can easily add discounts, coupons, and course bundles and packages.&nbsp;Plus, there are <em>thousands</em> of extensions available for shipping, marketing, automation, payments, social media, and anything else you can imagine. We like combining WooCommerce with <a href="https://iconicwp.com/">IconicWP</a>, which is a plugin that helps you create a fast and profitable ecommerce store without any technical knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Sell physical goods along with courses</strong>: Since WooCommerce allows you to sell any product, you can also list physical products for sale along with your courses. For instance, you can also sell T-shirts or merchandise to not only add a passive income stream but to create a community of fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LearnDash WooCommerce integration is popular because it provides enormous flexibility. If you’re looking to build the ultimate custom ecommerce experience, play around with WooCommerce as you build your storefront. </p>

<h3 id="h-reasons-not-to-use-woocommerce">Reasons <em>not</em> to use WooCommerce</h3>



<p>While it is incredibly powerful, WooCommerce does come with more of a learning curve than most other plugins and integrations. You might not want to use WooCommerce for LearnDash if:</p>



<p><strong>You’re looking for a quick and easy setup</strong>: Loads of customization options can also add confusion. If you’re looking for a super simple setup to get going immediately, you might find WooCommerce slowing you down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You have limited courses with a small audience</strong>: One of the best perks of WooCommerce is automation. But if you prefer to manage a small learner group manually, you may find you don’t need all of WooCommerce’s extra features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You’re concerned about site speed</strong>: If you don’t have premium hosting and you’re worried about site speed, keep in mind that WooCommerce is a huge plugin that takes up space on a website. You could potentially face unnecessary slowdowns with all of WooCommerce’s features.</p>



<p>If you’re offering a straightforward checkout experience without extra bells and whistles, you may want to stick with a smaller, simpler ecommerce solution.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-best-of-both-worlds-woocommerce-with-learndash-cloud">The best of both worlds: WooCommerce with LearnDash Cloud</h3>



<p>If you’re ready to harness the power of both WooCommerce and LearnDash, you can get started one of two ways: WooCommerce works with both the LearnDash plugin as well as LearnDash Cloud.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re looking to integrate WooCommerce into your existing LearnDash site, our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/woocommerce/">knowledgebase</a> article walks you through how to do this.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re setting up a new course site, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-cloud/">LearnDash Cloud</a> makes it easy to hit the ground running with WooCommerce. During set-up, you have the option to install WooCommerce right away as you configure your LearnDash Cloud website. This is a big perk if you already know you’d like to use a payment gateway other than Stripe upon setup. You can also rest easy knowing that your premium LearnDash Cloud hosting provides the speed you need to efficiently run WooCommerce on your site.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ready to try out LearnDash with WooCommerce? Give the <a href="https://demo.learndash.com/courses/basic-learndash-overview/">LearnDash Demo</a> a spin to see how our plugin works from a user&#8217;s perspective. Then, sign up for your own demo website with WooCommerce pre-installed to play in a sandbox environment.</p>

<p>Before creating your first online course, you might be thinking: <em>will anyone want to buy this?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Determining if there’s a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-for-determining-if-your-online-course-has-a-market/">market for your course</a> is an important first step in the creation process. The best way to do this is to conduct market research. Market research helps you understand who might want your course and ensure there’s enough demand.</p>



<p>Market research also helps you write content specifically tailored to your audience. Because of this, it’s important to perform market research early, preferrably in the ideation stage. The more you know about your market, the more you can speak to their specific pain points. Plus, the more useful and attractive your content becomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to start conducting market research for your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-determine-your-course-idea">Determine your course idea&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First thing, ask yourself: “is my course worth creating?” The hard truth is that your original idea may be wrong. Thankfully, you can use hard data to answer this question instead of relying on your own inner critic. Here are a few tools to help:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Check course marketplace sites. </strong>Exploring<strong> </strong>sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> can help you figure out how your online course fits into the broader market. Udemy lets you browse popular topics within subjects like business, design, marketing, and more. Check to see how extensively your course subject is already offered and which topics are most popular and trending.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Perform keyword research. </strong>There are a bevy of tools available for keyword research. Sites like <a href="https://sparktoro.com/product/dashboard">Sparktoro</a> can help you search what your audience is frequently talking about online. See what results come up to make sure your course topic is not only relevant but necessary.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stay up-to-date.</strong>&nbsp; Read industry news, blogs, and articles within your niche so that your course reflects the newest and latest within your subject field. Additionally, by staying up to date, you may find a new segment of the market who needs your online course.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-create-a-learner-persona">Create a Learner Persona</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.td.org/atd-blog/how-to-develop-learner-personas-for-effective-training">learner persona</a> is a similar concept to a buyer persona. It’s a representation of a potential student who may enroll in your course. The benefit of a learner persona is to get in the mind of your learner to find out what they would need from an online course. This single persona serves to represent the target market and can help focus your guidelines for developing an effective course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some key characteristics to fill out for your learner persona:</p>



<ul><li>Demographics (don’t forget to give your persona a name, too)&nbsp;</li><li>Their comfort level with the material (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Their pain points and goals within your niche. For example, are they looking for self-improvement, or to build on the skills learned in your course for their own business ventures?&nbsp;</li><li>Their level of technical ability. How streamlined should your own course be for their sake?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Conceptualizing your learner as a real person can help make sure you’re talking and writing like a human, both within your course as well as your marketing material.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-send-out-a-survey">Send Out a Survey</h2>



<p>Surverys can provide some quick feedback on how likely your audience would be to take your online course. Before sending out a survey, consider first your newly-created learner persona. Can you segment your market into a smaller group that fits the description of your learner persona? Send those folks the survey first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s an idea of what you can ask users in a survey:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If they’ve ever taken an online course&nbsp;</li><li>If they’ve taken a course, if the content was useful&nbsp;</li><li>How much they paid or would be willing to pay for an online course</li><li>If you offered a course on a chosen topic, would they take it?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>LearnDash integrates with SurveyMonkey for an automated process with a variety of trigger settings. For example, if a user enrolls in a course (even a free sample course), you can set up an automation to email your new learner with a survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, you can always create a generic survey before getting into LearnDash by using <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a> or your favorite survey tool, such as <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1011401&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_595123210492-ADGP_Desk%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20Forms_Google%20Forms-KWID_43700063921124670-kwd-299031573119&amp;utm_term=KW_google%20forms%20survey-ST_google%20forms%20survey&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsMGYBhAEEiwAGUXJaXgx4FPpy2hwcKmcjpDbhMeUXBxGute_xhyEsQHUWwcCBkMX0iorrRoC24sQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Google Forms</a>. You can even send out tailored buyer persona surveys using templates via tools like <a href="https://survicate.com/survey-templates/buyer-persona-survey/">Survicate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-check-out-the-competition">Check Out the Competition</h2>



<p>Once you’ve done some research on the marketplace and your audience, you’ll want to narrow your scope and look directly at your competitors. Start by making a list of who your course competes with for attention. Then, write down how they describe their course. Finally, compare&nbsp; your course idea and see what makes yours unique. The more you stand out from the crowd, you more you may pique learner’s interest.</p>



<p>Another helpful tool can be to perform a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT analysis</a> of competitors. A SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Growth) is a tried and true business strategy for planning and execution. You’ve likely already done this for your own course and brand, but have you considered your competitors from a SWOT analysis standpoint? You may learn that an area of weakness from your competitors is a potential opportunity for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-create-an-action-plan">Create an Action Plan</h2>



<p>With the knowledge gleaned from examining the market, creating a learner persona and a survey, and analyzing the competition, you can form an action plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your action plan, identify:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Your overall goal for the course</li><li>Your next steps&nbsp;</li><li>Your priorities organized by importance&nbsp;</li><li>Solutions to any problems you’ve identified</li><li>Due dates for deliverables (and your course going live!)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Remember, no amount of market research will give you a perfect answer as to whether your online course will be successful. However, conducting market research will help you determine if your course has a chance. In the end, you still need to execute properly if you want to start and grow an online course business.</p>

<p>What you call your course matters. After all, not only does your course name indicate the subject matter but like any good book, titles entice the user to learn more.</p>



<p>As you know, online audiences have short attention spans and often make snap decisions based on a quick first impression. Most folks only stay on a web page for about 15 seconds, so if the name of your course doesn’t grab their attention, they may click elsewhere for content that seems more worth their time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you think more critically about what to call your class, we’ve gathered six reasons why we think it’s important to have this conversation about your course name.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-your-course-appears-more-professional-when-branded">Your course appears more professional when branded</h3>



<p>If you’ve named courses before, bring the title to mind: how does the name reflect on your brand? Does the phrasing, wording, imaging, and banners all show the learner what your company is about? Everyone should think of how their course reflects on their brand. By using language you would use to describe your overall company aesthetic, you’re ensuring that your course is an extension of what you offer as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-good-course-name-allows-for-specific-design-elements">A good course name allows for specific design elements&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The more specific and focused your course name is, the more you can use it as a design framework. For example, instead of offering an “introduction to photography” course, your customers can say they enrolled in a “photography bootcamp” or “photography academy.” That sort of branding unlocks tons of potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bootcamp, for example, you can refer to lesson elements as “stations” where learners stop and practice a new skill. Learners can run “drills” (quizzes) to test their knowledge. With a focused, tailored title, it unlocks more potential for creative, unified, and specific course design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-seo-best-practices-can-attract-more-users">SEO best practices can attract more users&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you hope to grow traffic to your courses organically, you should be following <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-to-build-seo-strength-for-your-online-course/">SEO (search engine optimization) best practices</a>. We have some specific tips for course creation SEO from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-seo-to-sell-more-online-courses/">Rebecca Gill that can help you sell your courses</a>. Tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> help you find phrases, keywords, and search terms for a course name, along with how difficult it would be to rank each option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also run potential name ideas through <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CA">Google Trends</a>. This free service can help you identify search volume patterns as well as related search queries and topics. For example, if you search “how to vlog” in Google Trends, you’ll see the related topics are “YouTube” and “TikTok.” So, if you tailored a class especially for “how to vlog on TikTok,” you may hit a niche market where more folks will be interested in your course!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-you-apart-from-competitors">It sets you apart from competitors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the most important ideas behind why it’s important to think about your course title. Potential learners need to see right in the title that what you offer differs from your competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the photography bootcamp example. If your course fully embraces this concept of a “bootcamp” then over time, your course may be known among competitors as an intensive crash course on the subject. Other interested folks will start to recognize that your course design is different than any other basic course model and will gravitate towards your course as having a perceived benefit over the competition. All of this begins with a name!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-course-name-has-to-mean-something">A course name has to &#8220;mean&#8221; something</h3>



<p>One big mistake in naming courses is falling into the trap of being too cute or clever. Puns, acronyms, and other turns of phrases are fun and exciting to brainstorm, but at the end of the day, they are often empty cliches that don’t mean much. Relying too much on a pun can even mislead potential learners or turn them off. Clarity should beat cleverness every time.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-expectations-for-the-learners">It sets expectations for the learners&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to specificity for SEO purposes, specificity in your name should also address pain points your course is going to solve. One way to think about this is to answer the question:&nbsp; “What is the value of my course?” Most often, this goes back to learning outcomes, which are the objectives you want your learners to take away from the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the vlogging example. “How to vlog,” doesn’t quite mean anything. “How to vlog on TikTok” is better, but what are learners really taking away? “From Beginner to Pro: How to vlog on TikTok” explains a bit more the value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What folks are buying is a <em>transformation</em>. A great course name should set the expectation for how much work is ahead of them while also hinting at the benefits. How will your course make their lives better?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>With these considerations in mind, we hope you agree that it’s important to think deeply about what goes into your next course name. No matter how great your content, if the name doesn’t hint or showcase this, you might never entice folks enough to check it out.</p>

<p>If you plan to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-course-pricing-models-explained/">charge a premium for your course</a>, you must ensure the experience lives up to the price tag. That could mean offering a little something extra to help students justify the cost.</p>



<p>At a minimum, your course should provide top-notch content and a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-organize-your-online-course-content/">seamless student interface</a>. But you can also include a few extras to incentivize learners to sign up for your course. Here are five options to consider if you’re looking for ways to justify a higher course price and sweeten the deal for students.</p>



<h2>1. Share downloadable bonus content.</h2>



<p>People love a useful freebie. Templates, spreadsheets, worksheets, and other <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/ideas-to-use-pdf-in-elearning">downloadable goodies</a> provide value by helping students jump-start a project or apply course lessons to their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of freebie you offer will depend on your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-choose-a-topic-for-your-course-in-a-saturated-market/">course topic</a>. For example, if your course is about personal finance, you might give away a convenient budgeting spreadsheet to students who enroll.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Recruit a well-known instructor.</h2>



<p>You don’t need an A-list celebrity as the face of your course, but it helps to have a recognizable and reputable instructor. Prospective students will be more willing to pay a higher price if they’re confident in the teacher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure you—or whoever is teaching your course—is respected in your field and has relevant credentials. Highlight those credentials in your course description and emphasize your street cred wherever it’s relevant.</p>



<h2>3. Offer one-on-one coaching.</h2>



<p>Sometimes, online learning can feel a little impersonal—especially if students don’t receive individual attention from the instructor. Add a personal and premium touch to your course by offering one-on-one coaching to each student who signs up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might offer a 30-minute phone session with each student, for example, or you could offer in-depth, personalized feedback on one of the course assignments.</p>



<h2>4. Create a community.</h2>



<p>For some learners, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/creating-a-robust-social-community-within-your-lms/">connecting with other students</a> is just as valuable as a qualified instructor and one-on-one coaching. Make it easy for learners to network with each other by providing a private community just for class participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use an add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/restrict-content-pro/">Restrict Content Pro</a> to keep this community in a gated section of your website. You can also opt for a platform like Google Groups or Facebook Groups if that’s where your students prefer to interact.</p>



<h2>5. Provide certification.</h2>



<p>You can justify charging a little more for your course if it offers a worthwhile certification. This may require some extra work on your end to coordinate with the governing body or association for your industry, but it can be worth the extra effort to provide this added value to your learners—and give your course’s credibility a boost.</p>



<h2 id="h-justify-a-higher-course-price-with-learndash">Justify a higher course price with LearnDash.</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to create a high-ticket course, the capability of your course platform must also match the price. LearnDash was created by educators for course creators.

<p>The first step to organizing and promoting your online course with email marketing is to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">build an email list</a>.</p>



<p>On this list, you’ll add the customer&#8217;s email addresses to whom you want to sell your online course. Once you’ve done it, you can send a mass email to your contacts and get them to enroll in your training program.</p>



<p>How can you build your email list fast and from scratch? Follow these tips and upgrade your list-building strategy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Collect emails ethically and effectively — </strong>one thing you don’t want to do when building an email list is to be intrusive. Use embedded signup forms on your website to gather visitors’ data or build a strong customer referral program.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Collect the data you need — </strong>think about what kind of information you need from your customers. Design sign-up forms accordingly and keep them short. Ask people to fill in 1-3 fields to avoid form abandonment.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create useful content — </strong>update your content regularly and diversify your communications. Clients may get tired of receiving the same promotional email over and over again. Instead, offer them another type of content like blog articles, online courses or monthly newsletters.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Measure the results — </strong>check metrics like the click-to-open and conversion rates. Like this, you can analyze if your email marketing strategy is working as expected and how many people are subscribing to your course.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Customize every email — </strong>call readers by their name, but also send them relevant content depending on their buying preferences. You can get these insights if you track your email marketing campaign performance.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create engaging and shareable content — </strong>design a high-converting copy. You may offer the best online course ever, but if you don’t know how to sell it with words you’re lost. Use your brand’s tone of voice and be straightforward with your message.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Add a powerful CTA — </strong>drive users to take action and buy your online course. Place a CTA button or link at the end of the email to guide customers to a landing page. Command verbs like ‘subscribe’ or ‘register now’ work best.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Close the email with your email signature — </strong>be professional. An email signature shows you&#8217;re an established business and it reinforces interaction with the reader.</li></ul>



<p>If you use these hints, you’ll be one step closer to attracting customers to your online course. Your clients appreciate concision. Make sure to keep your email short and communicate your message as clearly as possible.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing can be one of the trickiest parts of launching a new course. It requires a balance between providing value to your audience and setting a price they’re willing to pay—or deciding if you’re going to charge for your courses at all.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose a course pricing model, it’s a good idea to compare the options and consider your revenue goals. Here are the four most common pricing models to consider as you plan and price your courses.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-1-free-courses">1. Free courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">Free courses</a> are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the content you have to offer. A free course or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later. If you’re just beginning to cultivate your audience, a free course can be a good starting point as you build up a customer base.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-baseline-courses">2. Baseline courses</h2>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience by providing content that appeals to many people at an affordable price point. These should be courses that you can create relatively quickly. They also shouldn’t require a huge time commitment from students or cover topics that are too in-depth or technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with lower participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-small-font-size"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-low-online-course-completion-rates-matter/"><strong>Do Low Online Course Completion Rates Matter?</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>3. Premium courses</h2>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points and deliver quality, in-depth content. Course material must be unique, taught by a reputable or well-known instructor, or cover a subject that you won’t find anywhere else—these attributes help justify the premium price point.</p>



<h2>4. Subscription courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-a-subscription-pricing-strategy/">Subscription model courses</a> offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. After becoming a member, students have unlimited access to your gated course content.</p>



<p>Regardless of which pricing model you choose, how can you be sure you’re setting the right price for your courses?</p>



<h2>The formula for setting your course price</h2>



<p>Setting the price for a course isn’t an exact science, but you can use the formula below to take some of the guesswork out of pricing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-price-an-online-course/"><strong>How to Price an Online Course</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>To get started, you’ll need a few key pieces of information.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Audience size. </strong>Take a look at your audience to determine how many people might be interested in your online course. You might start by adding up your total followers on social media or looking at the size of your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">email list</a>. If you’re creating a course on a niche topic, your potential audience may be a smaller segment of your larger audience. The audience size might change for every new course you create.</li><li><strong>Revenue goals. </strong>Think about <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">how much you want or need to earn</a> from the course. Do you need to cover costs to break even? Do you have an income goal? What is the total amount of revenue you expect to earn?</li><li><strong>Conversion. </strong>How many people in your potential audience do you expect to actually purchase the course? Using data from your email list, social media following, landing pages, or other campaign information, you can come up with an estimated conversion rate for your audience. This rate should be a percentage represented in a decimal: For example, if you expect 10% of your audience to convert, use 0.10 in the formula below.</li></ul>



<p>Now you’re ready to try out the formula:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Plug in different numbers to see how the course price changes based on your revenue goals, or how revenue increases or decreases at different course price points and conversion rates.</p>



<p>The optimal course price is one that allows you to meet your revenue goals given your audience size and estimated conversion rate.</p>



<h2>Reach your goals while staying grounded</h2>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. If you use the formula and it suggests an exorbitant course price, you might need to reconsider your goals; it’s unreasonable to charge $10,000 for 10 minutes of information, for example.</p>



<p>Ultimately, thinking about the different pricing models with the pricing formula as a guide will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for you and for your customer base.</p>

<p>Content is done, promotions are ready, and the last item on your pre-launch checklist is how to price an online course so that people will sign up. Pricing can be one of the trickiest elements of launching a new course online because it is a balance of finding that sweet spot of providing value to your target audience at a price they’re willing to pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriate online course building and pricing can help a content creator make the move from a side gig to full-time work. Well-developed online courses can drive revenue and even sponsorships for your website or brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to get started? Here are some pricing considerations to think about before launching a new online course.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-online-courses-starts-with-course-types"><strong>Pricing Online Courses Starts with Course Types</strong></h2>



<p>Online course expert <a href="https://sarahcordiner.com/price-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Cordiner</a> says that all content falls into one of five types of online courses. Of course, the type you plan to offer can correlate to value and pricing strategy. It’s important for content creators to keep this in mind as they develop online courses.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Lead Magnet Mini-Course:</strong> Generally, this is a free and short online course that helps get people interested in greater content. The mini-course may be the first lesson of a more comprehensive paid course that serves as a marketing lead.</li><li><strong>Kickstarter Course:</strong> These courses are a gateway for content creators into course development. These online courses might mimic other content you are creating, such as a how-to blog post series, in a different format. These courses are often low-priced (less than $100), aren’t long in duration (can be completed in a few minutes to an hour), and are ideal for creators that already have credibility and followers.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Authority Flagship Course:</strong> When you think of online courses, the Authority Flagship Model is probably what comes to mind first. These are courses with an established instructor that’s got plenty of credibility in their field, are moderately priced ($100 to $3,000), and include repeat logins or sessions (lasting about one hour each over several weeks). These courses include information that you can’t get elsewhere, such as a tutorial or in-depth explainer of a topic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supportive Coach-Lead Course:</strong> The content may be similar to an Authority Flagship Course, but the delivery is different. These courses are designed for self-study and independent, rather than mass, learning with touchpoints with the instructor. These online courses are higher-priced ($500 and up), include multiple sessions and one-on-one meetings, and plenty of information to help you succeed individually.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Membership or Online Academy Course:</strong> This group class is structured with multiple classes in a series that build on one another. Students might participate in different tracks to earn credentials or certifications. The pricing strategy is less about the cost of an individual course, but for the module as a whole using a subscription-based model ($10 to $100 per month).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>No matter which online course strategy you choose, you need to <a href="https://myelearningworld.com/how-to-price-your-online-course/">do your homework</a> to ensure that you are developing a course that people will want to take. It starts with research, audience understanding, marketing, and content development.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-pricing-models-for-online-courses"><strong>4 Pricing Models for Online Courses</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have developed a course and know what type of class you’ll offer, it’s time to really start thinking about pricing. There are four true tiers of online course pricing: free, baseline, and premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-free-courses">Free courses</h3>



<p>Free courses are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the course content you have to offer. A <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">free course</a> or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later.</p>



<h3 id="h-baseline-courses">Baseline courses</h3>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience with content that appeals to a lot of people at an economical price point. These courses should be quick to create, not involve huge participant time commitments, and include topics or information that goes in-depth, but doesn’t get too technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with low participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you give a coupon for a free class, the completion rate can be in the low single digits. When you charge for the same course, the completion rate can be 30% or 40%. The more you charge for a course, the more people actually complete it,” <a href="https://convertkit.com/how-to-price-your-online-course">said Ankur Nagpal, CEO and founder of Teachable</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-premium-courses">Premium courses</h3>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points but must deliver high-quality content at the same time. Course material must be unique, have a well-known instructor, or be something that you can’t get anywhere else to justify the price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of a premium online course as being on par with a university-level experience or led by a “celebrity” in a masterclass format. These courses won’t garner as many signups as baseline courses but often have high participation and engagement rates.</p>



<h3>Subscription model</h3>



<p>Subscription model courses offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. Once a member, your customer gets access to your gated content.</p>



<h2><strong>Online Course Pricing Strategy</strong></h2>



<p>One of the best formulas for pricing online courses comes from <a href="https://onlinecourseigniter.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-from-an-online-course/">Online Course Igniter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It starts with a little audience research so that you know how many people could potentially be interested in your online course. This audience could change for every new course, depending on the content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, you’ll want to think about how much money you want or need to make from the course. Do you have costs that you need to cover to break even? Do you have a set goal for income from each online course?</p>



<p>Then you are going to take a deep dive into your audience analytics. At this point, you probably have an email list, social media following, landing page, or another method to collect and interact with people who are interested in your content. What you need to determine is how interested they are to come up with an average conversion rate for that audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you can plug all the data into the basic formula to determine pricing and revenue:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Don’t forget to subtract any costs from revenue to <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">determine actual profit</a> on the online courses you create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. It’s unreasonable to ask someone to pay $1,000 for 10 minutes of information. Thinking about pricing models and perceived value will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for your customer base.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Much Should You Charge for an Online Course?</strong></h2>



<p>So, it all comes back to the central question: How much should you charge for an online course?</p>



<p>Thinking about course type, pricing models, and then a full pricing strategy the answer may be more clear than you think. (You should at least narrow it to a range quickly.)</p>

<p>Creating your online course is only the first step of the journey.</p>



<p>You’ve spent good money and tons of hours to create a valuable course for your audience, but now, <em>how will you sell that course?</em></p>



<p>As a course creator, there are a few areas of marketing that are going to be crucial to the success of your online course.</p>



<p><em>SEO.</em></p>



<p><em>Content creation.</em></p>



<p><em>Email marketing.</em></p>



<p>But<strong> your email list is</strong> <strong>your bread and butter.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s where you capture and own your audience. Where you develop long-term relationships with your audience.&nbsp; Where you build trust with people.</p>



<p><em>And it’s where most people are likely to buy from you.</em> The best time to start your email list was a year ago, and the second-best time to start is NOW.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll dig into 7 ways you, as a course creator, can start growing your email list. Each of these 7 tactics we consider to be “lead generation tactics” and work best if followed up with an automated welcome sequence or sales sequence.</p>



<p>So why are these “lead generation tactics” so important for course creators?</p>



<p>Believe it or not, not everyone who lands on your website is ready to buy from you. Even those who are very interested in your course!</p>



<p>Most of the time, it takes a bit of nurturing and trust-building for folks to buy your courses or products. Your email list is the place where all of that happens!</p>



<p>And the best part?</p>



<p>When you create new courses or products, run special offers, or have new announcements — your email list is a captive audience of raving fans.</p>



<p>So let’s jump into these 7 Email List Building Tactics, so you can start selling more of your course!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-give-away-the-first-video-of-your-course-for-free"><strong>1. Give away the first video of your course…for free.</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s just go ahead and start with a bang.</p>



<p>Overcoming objections is a very common tactic in sales, and if you’re going to sell more of your course, you’ll need to anticipate your audience’s objections and head them off.</p>



<p>OBJECTION: If people are hesitant to buy your online course, it’s quite possible that they simply aren’t sure that the course is exactly what they need.</p>



<p>Giving away the first video of the course for free is a fantastic way to <strong>overcome that objection</strong> and show people that your course is <em>exactly the thing they need</em> to solve whatever problem they’re experiencing.</p>



<p>Or, it proves that the course isn’t what they need.</p>



<p>Either way, by giving away the first part of your course for free, you become etched as a trustworthy and generous brand in the mind of your audience — and that goes a long way.</p>



<p>P.S. If you’re worried about giving too much away for free, remember that the first video of your course is only a sample. It’s likely that they can’t really do anything without the entire course curriculum, right?</p>



<p>So be generous and give that first video away. I think you’ll be surprised to see the amount of sales that roll in from this little trick.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-create-a-free-video-course"><strong>2. Create a free video course.</strong></h3>



<p><em>MORE free stuff?!</em> You better believe it. Anyone who has been to Costco on a Sunday knows that we love freebies.</p>



<p>But before you get too worked up about creating ANOTHER course (and giving it away for free nonetheless), let me explain a little.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>*This free course does not have to be highly produced, and it doesn’t have to be long.*</strong></p>



<p>It just has to be valuable, aligned with your audience’s aspirational identity, and delivered via email over a set number of days.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.brandbuildersgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brand Builders Group</a> does a great job with this in their free course <a href="http://firststeptofamous.com/jf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Step to Famous.”</a></p>



<p>When someone opts in for the free course, they immediately receive the first video of the series in their inbox.</p>



<p>Then, over the next few days, the rest of the free course is delivered via email one video per day, with each video creating enough intrigue to prompt viewers back to the inbox the next day.</p>



<p>And at the end of the free video series?</p>



<p>You pitch your paid course, of course.</p>



<p>The benefits of giving away a free course are enormous. Not only is it attractive for your audience to get free content, in the process you simultaneously build trust with your audience AND you subconsciously train them to look for value every time they see your name pop up in the inbox.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-give-away-a-cheatsheet-or-checklist"><strong>3. Give away a “Cheatsheet” or “Checklist”.</strong></h3>



<p>I think classic whitepapers and PDFs are dying out. BUT…this does not mean that downloadable offers are irrelevant.</p>



<p>With so much information readily available from a quick Google search, we are less likely to give up our email addresses for information.</p>



<p><strong>We will, however, give up an email address for organization and application</strong>.</p>



<p>When you create a downloadable offer, make sure that it’s something your prospects can actually use. If your offer is just information, there’s a solid chance it will collect dust in the back corners of their Macbook.</p>



<p>Checklists and cheatsheets are two great ways to compile useful information into something more tangible.</p>



<p>Think “The Project Manager’s Ultimate Kickoff Meeting Checklist”, or “The Mama’s Cheatsheet to Daytime Naps”.</p>



<p>Instead of just giving information, create an offer that will be used daily and that is not likely to be found in a quick Google search.</p>



<p>Set up your Cheatsheet or Checklist with a pop up on your website and watch the leads roll in!</p>



<h3 id="h-4-start-a-newsletter"><strong>4. Start A Newsletter.</strong></h3>



<p>“Newsletters are dead, Jeff.”</p>



<p>False &amp; erroneous. Newsletters that just talk about your company ARE dead. Newsletters that talk about the reader are NOT.</p>



<p>A common mistake that people make with email newsletters is turning them into company bulletin boards.</p>



<p><em>“Check out our company picnic.</em></p>



<p><em>Here are our new hires.<br>Here’s a word from our president.”</em></p>



<p>I agree, nobody gives a rip about those newsletters.</p>



<p><strong><em>What people will sign up for, however, is regular content that makes their lives better.</em></strong></p>



<p>Enter the lead generating newsletter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoolist.com/best-newsletters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brands like these ones&nbsp;</a>are roping in new subscribers by the thousands to their daily, weekly, or monthly newsletters.</p>



<p>The keys to creating a successful newsletter, though, are that the theme has to <strong>be aspirational to the audience it&#8217;s trying to reach</strong>, and the <strong>content has to be extremely valuable</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, creating a desirable newsletter such as this requires an intimate knowledge of your audience.</p>



<p>The better you know your target audience, the more likely you can strike gold with a regular newsletter that <em>your prospects can’t wait to sign up for.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-create-a-quiz"><strong>5. Create a Quiz.</strong></h3>



<p>Quizzes have long been known as effective lead generators. But the statistics are truly staggering.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActiveCampaign</a> found that quizzes can generate up to <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/5-secrets-to-using-quizzes-lead-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25x more leads</a> than a standard popup offering a PDF!</p>



<p>Similar to the newsletter, quizzes that tap into an aspirational identity with the target audience perform even better.</p>



<p>We are naturally curious and love to learn new things about ourselves and quizzes allow us to do that.</p>



<p>The brilliance of including a quiz as part of your lead generation strategy is that it creates an environment of engagement right from the get-go.</p>



<p>The more you engage your audience at the beginning of your relationship with them, the more likely it is that they will continue to engage with your brand in the future and respond to well-targeted offers.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-put-on-a-webinar"><strong>6. Put on a Webinar.</strong></h3>



<p>Webinars have quickly become one of the more popular lead generation tools in the last few years.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because they’re interactive, they establish you as a trusted authority, and <em>the leads are usually pretty warm</em>.</p>



<p>As the e-learning market grows, the amount of time we spend consuming webinars has <a href="https://on24.drift.click/c053a93b-23d9-42c6-b0e9-e92d536977a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased nearly 3x</a>, as well.</p>



<p>Webinars work especially well for launching a new course. According to Podia, 53% of marketers say that webinars generate the most high quality top-of-funnel leads, and as many as 40% of webinar attendees become qualified leads.</p>



<p>These are significant numbers, and prove how highly effective webinars can be to selling your new courses right out of the gate.</p>



<p>When your new course is ready to launch, set up a free webinar to introduce the course, teach a section of the course, or teach something related to the course topic.</p>



<p>Then, broadcast an announcement for the webinar across your social channels and on your website to invite people to attend.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-offer-a-discount"><strong>7. Offer a Discount.</strong></h3>



<p>I don’t recommend a discount for everyone, and some brands just aren’t into that kind of thing.</p>



<p><em>The only times</em> I would really suggest a discount is the launch of your brand, the launch of a new course, or around special holidays.</p>



<p>Needless to say…</p>



<p>Discounts have a way of piquing our interest and introducing a sense of urgency in a way that nothing else can.</p>



<p>It’s a double-edged sword, though. If you offer discounts too often, they just become noise and people will start to expect discounts or wait for your next discount to purchase your courses.</p>



<p>When you need a little momentum, say at the launch of a course, offering a discount just might be the best way to inject a little jet fuel and get things rockin’ and rollin’.</p>



<p>Just make sure you require people to opt-in with an email address to receive the discount code!</p>



<h3 id="h-final-words"><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>



<p>Building an audience can be challenging.</p>



<p>Finding the right strategy for generating leads onto your email list sometimes takes making educated guesses and iteration after iteration.</p>



<p>You might not get it just right the first time. But the truth is, <em>one well-working funnel can change your life.</em></p>



<p>Find the right lead generation tactic that works for you, your brand, and your audience,&nbsp;</p>



<p>attach a sales sequence to it,&nbsp;and set up a monthly <a href="http://www.contentremedy.co/blog/simple-email-marketing-strategy">broadcast strategy</a> to stay top of mind with your audience.</p>

<p>Many customers expect the option to try before they buy when considering a purchase—after all, most of us wouldn’t drive off the lot in a new car without taking it for a test drive first.</p>



<p>The same can be true for students considering enrolling in your online courses. Even though <em>you </em>know your content is top-notch, a new customer might not be convinced before seeing it for themself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering some of your course content for free, you can give prospective students a taste of the class before they move forward with a purchase. If giving away the goods seems counterintuitive, rest assured: Offering a freebie doesn’t mean you’re leaving money on the table. In fact, it could lead to <em>more </em>revenue by attracting a greater number of students to try out your courses and ultimately make a purchase.</p>



<p>Ready to use free course content to strengthen your business and increase sales? Here are a few ways to get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-offer-a-sample-lesson"><strong>Offer a sample lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s say you sell online Italian courses. Maybe a prospective student isn’t sure they’ll be self-motivated or engaged enough to stick to the lessons. By offering a sample lesson of your beginner’s course, students can make sure the class structure and approach is a good fit for the way they learn—then they’ll be ready to buy the full course.</p>



<p>With a tool like LearnDash, you can easily create free <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/sample-lessons/">sample lessons</a>. Simply toggle a switch in your lesson&nbsp; settings to open up the lesson of your choice to anyone who’s interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Unlock a paid course</strong></h2>



<p>If a sample lesson is the amuse-bouche that gives students a taste of your content, unlocking a paid course is like handing out a free lunch.</p>



<p>This generous freebie allows prospective customers to go deeper into your content than what they’d experience in a sample lesson. Maybe they even take a few <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/quizzes/">quizzes</a> and watch some video content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a robust course catalog, opening up a whole course for free can be an effective way to familiarize students with your content before they buy additional courses. This approach also works well if your courses are structured in a progression: For example, you might unlock the first course in a series, then students can purchase subsequent courses to take their knowledge to the next level.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong><em>Already have a YouTube playlist that you’re ready to repackage as a free course? Use the </em><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-create-wizard/"><em>Course Create Wizard</em></a><em> in LearnDash to create an entire course from a playlist URL.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Think beyond sales</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free">Gated content</a> isn’t just a marketing tool for white papers and ebooks. Whether you offer a sample lesson or an entire course for free, you can require students to register for free content. This allows you to collect their email addresses and build a high-quality <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">email marketing</a> list.</p>



<p>Ultimately, free course content can also generate powerful word-of-mouth marketing. You never know who might try a sample lesson and recommend your course to someone who becomes your next customer.</p>

<p><strong>Your course customers want your course but they don’t want to jump through hoops to buy it. Creating a seamless checkout experience will not only wow your customers but improve your conversion rates to increase your profits.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At this point, you’ve probably already launched your course and you’re seeing a good amount of traffic. But that traffic isn’t translating into bigger numbers in your bank account due to an increased cart abandonment rate.</p>



<p>Currently, the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">cart abandonment rate</a> for ecommerce sites is sitting at nearly 70% across the board with the culprit hiding within the checkout process. That sounds discouraging but there’s hope for your online courses and it starts with optimizing your sales funnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What’s a sales funnel?</strong></p>



<p>A sales funnel is just marketing jargon for your sales process. On the surface every ecommerce business model has a sales funnel that starts with capturing a prospective customer’s attention and nurturing them until they make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to selling your LearnDash courses, your sales funnel will need a few tweaks to create a smoother sales process for your customer that will encourage them to complete the checkout process. More checkout completions equals more conversions and that means more profits for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to increase conversion rates on your LearnDash course checkout page with WooFunnels&nbsp;</strong></p>
